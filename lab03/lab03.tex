    \section{Introduction}
        \par Newton's Laws and Newtonian physics accurately describe the 
        relationships between point particle motion and the forces
        that act on these particles.
        Newton's Second Law describes the mathematical relationship 
        between a force acting on a body, the body's mass, and the
        acceleration that the body experiences. This is expressed with
        the equation $F_{net} = ma$ where $F_{net}$ is the net force experienced
        by an object, $m$ is its mass and $a$ is the acceleration the object
        experiences
        \par Newton's Second Law can be tested experimentally through a variety
        of physical methods. The following experiment uses an Attwood Machine,
        a device that consists of two weights connected through a string, run
        through an eleveated pulley. By finding the apparent force of gravity
        and the acceleration of the masses, one can test Newton's Second Law
        by plugging measurements into $F_{net} = ma$.

        %The masses are both suspended, hanging on
        %the pulley, and gravity appears to exer a pulling force on both masses.
        %These apparent forces result in a net acceleration that depends on the
        %mass of the weights. By knowing the force that gravity exerts on the
        %masses, we can

    \section{Methods}
        \subsection{Experiment Setup}
            Fixate the vertical bar so it is perpendicular to the ground.
            Attach the pulley to the vertical bar and run the string over
            the pulley
